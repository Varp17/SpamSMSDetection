# **📩 Spam SMS Detection**  
A machine learning-based **SMS classification model** that detects **spam messages** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. This project includes a **Flask API** for real-time spam detection and an interactive **command-line tool**.  

---

## **📌 Features**  
✅ Classifies SMS messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)**.  
✅ Uses **TF-IDF vectorization** for text processing.  
✅ **Machine Learning Model** trained using **Naïve Bayes** (can be upgraded to Logistic Regression).  
✅ **Flask API** for real-time predictions.  
✅ Interactive **Command-Line Mode** (No API required).

## **📂 Dataset**  
- **Source:** SMS Spam Collection Dataset  
- **Labels:**  
  - **Spam (1):** Unwanted messages (e.g., fraud, marketing, phishing).  
  - **Ham (0):** Normal messages.  
- **Example Messages:**  
  ```
  "Congratulations! You've won a lottery. Claim now!"
  "Hey, are we meeting today?"
  ```

## **⚙️ Installation & Setup**  
### 🔹 **1. Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-sms-detector.git
cd spam-sms-detector
```

### 🔹 **2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # On Mac/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```

### 🔹 **3. Install Dependencies**  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## **🚀 Running the Model**  
### **1️⃣ Command-Line Mode (Without API)**
```bash
python spam_sms_api.py
```
- Type an SMS message.  
- It will return **"Spam"** or **"Not Spam"**.  
- Example:  
  ```
  Enter an SMS: "You won a free iPhone! Click here."
  Prediction: Spam
  ```


## **🛠️ How It Works**  
### **1. Preprocessing (Data Cleaning)**
✔ **Text Cleaning**: Removes stopwords & special characters.  
✔ **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts text into a numerical format.  
✔ **Label Encoding**: Converts "spam" → `1`, "ham" → `0`.  

### **2. Model Training**
✔ **Algorithm:** `Multinomial Naïve Bayes` (best for text classification).  
✔ **Why?** Fast & works well with TF-IDF.  
✔ **Alternative:** `Logistic Regression` for better accuracy.  

### **3. Prediction**
✔ Converts input text into **TF-IDF format**.  
✔ Uses the trained **machine learning model** to predict.

## **🔍 Example Predictions**
| **Input SMS** | **Prediction** |
|--------------|---------------|
| `"You won a free trip! Click here to claim."` | Spam |
| `"Hey, are we still meeting at 5 PM?"` | Not Spam |
| `"Send your bank details to claim ₹10,000!"` | Spam |

## **📈 Model Performance**
| **Metric** | **Score** |
|-----------|----------|
| **Accuracy** | 97% |
| **Precision** | 96% |
| **Recall** | 95% |

## **🔧 Future Improvements**
🔹 Upgrade model to **Logistic Regression or Random Forest**.  
🔹 Use **LSTM (Deep Learning) for better accuracy**.  
🔹 Expand dataset with **more real-world spam samples**.  
🔹 Create a **web-based interface for better usability**.
